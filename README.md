PySYS is a Python-based tool for retrieving and analyzing astronomical data from catalogs like 2MASS, UKIDSS GPS, GLIMPSE, MIPSGAL, and ALLWISE. It helps astronomers identify and classify young stellar objects (YSOs) in star-forming regions using NIR and MIR photometric data, focusing on Class I and II evolutionary stages.
